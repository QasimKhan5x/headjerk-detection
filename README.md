## Credits
We would like to thank the authors of [RealHePoNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01890) for providing a project that can be used for head posture recognition.
We have used the models and scripts that they have specified in their [Quickstart guide](https://github.com/rafabs97/headpose_final#quick-start-guide).
Please follow their guide to setup the environment required to run `code/Write Videos.ipynb`.
